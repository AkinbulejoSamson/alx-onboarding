The following pseudo code assumes that the numbers are given as an array

- Initialize a variable SUM = 0
- Cycle through elements of the array using a FOR loop
  initialize elements index position, set a limit using array length, increment index
    increment the variable SUM with the square of each element 
- After the FOR loop ends, return the variable SUM and display via print statement
